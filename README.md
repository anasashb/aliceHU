# **A**utomated **L**earning for **I**nsightful **C**omparison and **E**valuation (ALICE)
Automated Learning for Insightful Comparison and Evaluation (ALICE) merges conventional feature selection and the concept of inter-rater agreeability in a simple, user-friendly manner to seek insights into black box Machine Learning models. Currently supports (and has been tested on) Scikit-Learn and Keras models.
